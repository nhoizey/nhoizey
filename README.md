### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am a co-founder and Chief Innovation Officer at [Clever Age](https://www.clever-age.com/en/). I help companies design the right technical architecture to cover their digital needs, with the best possible choice of technologies and solutions. Drawing on over 20 years of experience, I advocate a pragmatic use of Web technologies, defining and applying good technical and methodological practices.

Current personnal (pet) projects include:
- ðŸ–¼ easing usage of **responsive images** with [images-responsiver](https://github.com/nhoizey/images-responsiver) and [eleventy-plugin-images-responsiver](https://github.com/nhoizey/eleventy-plugin-images-responsiver)
- ðŸŽ® helping people **have fun** with my little puzzle game [esviji](https://github.com/esviji/esviji)
- ðŸ¤¯ preventing headaches to developers with my VS Code extension [Gremlins](https://github.com/nhoizey/vscode-gremlins)
