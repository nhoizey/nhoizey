### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am a **co-founder and Chief Innovation Officer at [Clever Age](https://www.clever-age.com/en/)**. I help companies design the right technical architecture to cover their digital needs, with the best possible choice of technologies and solutions.

Drawing on over 20 years of experience (I wrote my first HTML page in 1996), I advocate a **pragmatic use of standard Web technologies**, defining and applying good technical and methodological practices: progressive enhancement, accessibility, web performance, Responsive Web Design, Progressive Web Apps, etc.

I run numerous seminars and practical training sessions, and give [talks](https://nicolas-hoizey.com/talks/) at conferences, to pass on my knowledge.

I am **located in Paris, France**, but some assignments for international clients take me to other countries and even other continents.

Current pet projects include:
- ðŸ–¼ easing usage of **responsive images** with [images-responsiver](https://nhoizey.github.io/images-responsiver/), [eleventy-plugin-images-responsiver](https://nhoizey.github.io/images-responsiver/eleventy-plugin-images-responsiver/) and [jekyll-cloudinary](https://nhoizey.github.io/jekyll-cloudinary/)
- ðŸŽ® helping people **have fun** with my little puzzle game [esviji](https://github.com/esviji/esviji)
- ðŸ¤¯ **preventing headaches to developers** with my VS Code extension [Gremlins](https://github.com/nhoizey/vscode-gremlins)
