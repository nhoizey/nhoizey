### Hi there 👋

I am a co-founder at [Clever Age](https://www.clever-age.com/en/). I help companies **design the right technical architecture to cover their digital needs**, with the best possible choice of technologies and solutions.

🧠 Drawing on over 25 years of experience (I wrote my first HTML page in 1996), I advocate a **pragmatic use of standard Web technologies**, defining and applying good technical and methodological practices: progressive enhancement, accessibility, web performance, Responsive Web Design, Progressive Web Apps, etc.

👨🏻‍🏫 I run numerous seminars and practical training sessions, and give [talks](https://nicolas-hoizey.com/talks/) at conferences, to pass on my knowledge.

🇫🇷 I am **located in Paris, France**, but some assignments for international clients take me to other countries and even other continents.

📸 I'm also a self-taught amateur photographer. I love to travel to discover new horizons and people, shooting both nature and urban landscapes, and many other topics. And I love to share this on [my own photography site](https://nicolas-hoizey.photo).

Current pet projects include:
- 🖼 easing usage of **responsive images** with [images-responsiver](https://nhoizey.github.io/images-responsiver/), [eleventy-plugin-images-responsiver](https://nhoizey.github.io/images-responsiver/eleventy-plugin-images-responsiver/) and [jekyll-cloudinary](https://nhoizey.github.io/jekyll-cloudinary/)
- 🎮 helping people **have fun** with my little puzzle game [esviji](https://play.esviji.com/)
- 🤯 **preventing headaches to developers** with my VS Code extension [Gremlins](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=nhoizey.gremlins)
